    <h2 class="page_one_heading">1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
    <P class="page_one_a">
        The website I have created consists of seven pages. The index page serves as the homepage when you first enter the web address. As it is the first page that a visitor to the site would see it’s important that it sets the president -both in terms of appearance and content- for the rest of the website. Therefore, it’s the first place you see the header/menu style I have opted for. The stamp background image I have used as the background image is behind all the menu options throughout the site. The text for the menu also stays the same, this creates a harmonious image throughout. I opted to remove the hyperlink underlining and  font colour from all my links as I don’t think it suits the aesthetic I wanted to create for my site. The content of the index page is my about me section to introduce myself before they delve deeper into the site. Below the introductory text are three images, one is of myself as I think it’s nice for the viewer to be able to associate the website with a face making the experience more personable and hopefully making me more employable. I have also included two images that allude to women in tech and coding as this is an issue that is important to me but also is topical for the website. Hopefully, including these images purveys to the viewer that I have a genuine interest and passion and tech and the issues that are prevalent in the industry. My next pages all use the same format, as they all contain similar subject matter. Below the aforementioned header menu there is a  heading for each page to easily indicate to the viewer which page they are currently on. Each page is then broken down into questions and their respective answers.All the questions are left aligned to the margin and are in a yellow font. The answers are all set in from the margin with pink font and have a padding border on the left. This clear distinction helps define my answers and questions and makes the pages more readable. I have also included a page dedicated to my python project. After explaining the page in text I have then embedded the game via Trinket <a href="https://trinket.io/">[18].</a> I felt it was important to embed the game in my site rather than including an off site link because it lends better to the inclusion of my website. Whereas all other links open in a new browser page as they should be viewed alongside the existing content of my site. My final page is my contact page, it is probably the simplest page as it contains three text based links to my social media sites and email.

    <h2 class="page_one_heading">1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
    <P class="page_one_a">
        Copyright is a legal protection for who owns created content for all types of creative work and whilst this does not include industrial or technological inventions it can include computer software as a creative work, which means that it can be considered protected under copyright. Sometimes copyright and intellectual property overlap but “websites contain written material, graphics, business logos, and other visual and sound elements. This firmly categorizes them as copyrightable material” <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/website-copyright-law/#U_K">[19].</a> Whilst each country's law may differ slightly, in the UK according to the Copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations 1992, websites are protected as soon as they are published, including trademarks. Therefore, copyright will affect the images, written material and  any video or sound among other content that you have not yourself created but intend to publish on your website.

    <h2 class="page_one_heading">1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account</h2>
    <P class="page_one_a">
        Whilst advances in technology have helped technology itself become more accessible to all. The vast majority of websites are still not accessible to people with certain conditions. Epilepsy sufferers for example may find websites with flashing video or animation sets off their condition, therefore ideally a flash warning should be displayed for these users. For people with vision related disabilities and complete blindness, accessing the internet could be potentially impossible. However, thankfully there are technologies such as screen readers <a href="https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers">[20],</a> that read websites aloud to users that are vision impared or blind. Screen readers are aided by the use of alt tags where images are concerned and therefore for a screen reader technology to be as effective as possible alt tags should be as descriptive as possible in order to be accessible for vision impaired and blind website users.  For elderly users and those with learning difficulties it is best to keep your text simple and break up large chunks of text so they are more readable. Whilst the aforementioned users may benefit from the readability of black text on a white background users with dyslexia will find that harder to read so a yellow tinged white background would be a more astute choice. There are lots of solutions to making online websites more accessible for people with disabilities, it's simply a case of knowing who your audience is, doing research as to how you can better accommodate them and making adjustments based on that information <a href= "https://mashable.com/2014/04/22/website-disability-friendly/?europe=true">[21]</a>.

    <h2 class="page_one_heading">1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
    <P class="page_one_a">
        All file types have their own advantages and disadvantages to being saved as such. An example of this image file types, which can be broken down into three comparison points: performance, appearance and scalability. These are the rate at which images load on your site, how high of a quality the image is displayed in and how the image looks on different sized screens. The most common image file types are JPEG, PNG and GIF. Whilst JPEG and PNG are non animated images,with JPEG being preferable for images with a higher colour saturation, and PNG being better utilized for images where scalability will come into use. GIF’s are animated images so whilst they hold a unique advantage over the other two file types in that sense, their downfall is that image quality and scalability can sometimes suffer as a result of using the GIF file type <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/best-image-format/">[22].</a> In terms of website creation, having used CSS and HTML to create my website they are saved as their own file types respectively. Another common file type that you will come across when using websites is an EXE file type used to install a downloaded program. You should be weary of this file type though as unfortunately sometimes they may contain viruses <a href=" https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html">[23].</a>
