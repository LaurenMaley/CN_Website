        <P class="page_one_a">
            Whilst HTML and CSS are incredibly easy to use and I believe they were the best choice for me personally to use in creating my website. Using HTML and CSS also means that you have to switch between documents as I used an External Style Sheet <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/difference-between-inline-external-and-internal-css">[16].</a> This could contribute to a slowing down in terms of efficiency and productivity and could be rectified by either changing the type of CSS I used or changing coding language altogether. Regardless of the coding language that I used, a visual drawn out plan before I began coding could have increased my productivity and efficiency, as I would have had a visual guide to work from rather than making stylistic choices as I worked. Additionally, it would have meant that I would have had an idea of the coding I would have required in advance, and could have therefore researched these methods beforehand, instead of in the moment. I completed this project as an individual, and when making a website that is about you and your work I believe this to be more optimal for efficiency and productivity as opposed to working in a team. Whilst working in a team would mean that the workload would be spread more evenly, and increase the amount of knowledge contributed, it would complicate decision making, and therefore nullify any efficiency gained by spreading the workload.

        <h2 class="page_one_heading">3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
        <P class="page_one_a">
            Whilst there are many ways to increase productivity and efficiency; such as planning via Trello. There are some ways to do this that are unique to working in a digital environment for IT  projects. For example, code review would be the most useful way for a digital project to run more smoothly. Code review could be done by strangers with relevant knowledge through forums, though this method runs risks of security of the project being compromised and the information being incorrect. Alternatively, screen sharing with trusted peers through means such as Zoom, would be far more secure and trustworthy. However, “working in a digital sphere is grounds for distractions. Everything and anything can be found at the click of the button. Often, people find themselves going down funnels. What initially is meant to be a quick scan of Twitter to see relevant conversations turns into a deep dive into influencer drama. It’s human nature to explore beyond the scope which we are given — ergo, a majority of us have found ourselves in this boat.”<a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/10/01/5-ways-digital-world-advancements-improve-productivity/">[17].</a> Whilst this issue is easier to rectify if working in a team where you can be held accountable for your work output by colleagues. A strict adherence to a schedule could be implemented to hold an individual accountable and help with productivity.

        <h2 class="page_one_heading">3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>
        <P class="page_one_a">
            In applying the above solutions in terms of improving my own productivity and efficiency, rather than feeling the need to complete the project as part of a team; having colleagues to work alongside would help me in being more focused on my work and less likely to procrastinate or become distracted. Therefore improving my productivity and efficiency.An additional benefit of this solution would be that colleagues could also offer advice in regards to improvements I could make on the website and save time in researching new code to implement.

        <h2 class="page_one_heading">3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
        <P class="page_one_a">
            When creating code a common problem that can occur is copying and pasting can affect the syntax, which if not corrected can cause the whole code not to work. Additionally, editing found code to fit your own purposes can also result in similar errors if you don’t fully understand the function of the code you are using. The solution to both these issues is simply research into the code you are using in order to foster full understanding of the syntax you write and avoid any problems a mis-type may cause. I have found it of vital importance to carefully read my code as a simple space can be the difference between the success and failure of code.
