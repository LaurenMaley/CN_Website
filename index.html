      <B> Welcome to my website -made by me from scratch using HTML and CSS (aren't you impressed?).
        <br>
        <br>
        My name is Lauren Maley, I am a film graduate with a passion for tech. Whilst working towards my degree I gained lots of experience working with lots of different film-making technologies such as Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, as well as the hardware involved in filming too. 
        <br>
        <br>
        And whilst working in retail I came into contact with many different softwares created to help the businesses run more smoothly such as  different TAPOS systems and warehouse management systems as well as the standard Microsoft office.
        <br>
        <br>
        Alongside using these technologies in professional aspects, I also enjoy casual gaming in my personal life, this led to some of my earliest experiences of coding- though I was oblivious as to what that was at the time. As a child I played Sims on a pc and Neopets online. Through these games I was able to experience and edit coding for the first time. Once I became an adult, I was aware of coding being more prevalent in the world and more ingrained in daily life. However, I assumed that it was incredibly difficult to learn and likely inaccessible to me. 
        <br>
        <br>
        However, thankfully I was able to find out about Code Nation where in only three weeks I was able to be introduced to Python, HTML and CSS and use them to create my own working projects from scratch, both individually and as part of a team. With the knowledge I have gained in this time I hope to be able to work in the future as a Software developer and in the meantime, create more projects that will develop my knowledge further.</B>
