  <h2 class="page_one_heading">1.1-Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>
  <P class="page_one_a">
    From personal experience I know how imperative IT is in the running of an international company, more specifically a retail business. Every aspect of running a company now relies on seamless IT being implemented throughout the business. Stock systems in the modern day rely heavily on the IT systems in place to track stock. From stock held in main warehouses being distributed to each of the stores as well as each store's personal warehouses. Point of sale (POS) systems connected to the stock systems allow companies to track trends in their sales and review popularity of products, utilizing this information to aid the business. An online presence whether it be via a website or social networking sites, is crucial for advertising, expanding your customer base and potentially online sales.<a href= "https://smallbusiness.chron.com/information-technology-its-role-modern-organization-1800.html">[1]</a> Without this it is increasingly difficult for a company to thrive in the modern IT based climate, this has been proven as many companies have gone under during the global covid pandemic as they were unable to implement online services or sales. Furthermore, for smaller businesses social networking sites can act as free advertising if paying for online advertising or a website is out of budget. Additionally, new technology gives smaller businesses and online businesses easier access to online payments through fund transfer services like Paypal<a href="https://www.paypal.com/">[2]</a> and the ability to accept card payments through mobile apps and devices like iZettle<a href="https://www.izettle.com/gb">[3]</a>.

  <h2 class="page_one_heading">1.2-Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
  <p class="page_one_a">
    Each digital project will have different requirements. Therefore, it would be prudent to research which technologies, products and softwares would best aid you and your project. This extends to acquiring the appropriate knowledge for your project, for example, you may need to learn a new coding language or software, this could be done via online courses. When creating a website knowledge of HTML and CSS would be necessary. A project that requires a larger team would benefit from conference calling technology such as Zoom<a href="https://zoom.us/">[4]</a> or Google hangouts<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-hangouts/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd?hl=en">[5]</a> and project management tools like Slack<a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/">[6]</a>, Asana<a href="https://asana.com/campaign/pac/see?&utm_campaign=Brand--UK--EN--Core--EX&utm_source=google&utm_medium=pd_cpc_br&gclid=CjwKCAjwsan5BRAOEiwALzomX9HeLCzZx2ChFnlNR7c9Ba1CsZlXy0TlAh8dqY1odJUtPX7aCSKa6BoCOIYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">[7]</a> or Monday<a href="https://monday.com/?utm_source=adwordsbrand&utm_campaign=gb-brand-e-desk&aw_keyword=monday&aw_match_type=e&gclid=CjwKCAjw34n5BRA9EiwA2u9k37zd4difQ-49oTu68313NJXHFbaz72-IulhB2CoCv3L5yff-jmipRxoC1J4QAvD_BwE">[8]</a>. A solo operator would likely benefit from portable technology such as a tablet or laptop to work from whilst a team with a permanent location would likely find desktops more appropriate.

  <h2 class="page_one_heading">1.3-Plan and carry out tasks using IT </h2>
  <p class="page_one_a">
    Utilizing Trello<a href="https://trello.com/home">[9]</a> which is a digital organisational tool that can help you split your tasks into to do, doing and done columns this method of working is called kanban<a href="https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban">[10]</a> . The ability to separate your tasks into these columns means that you are constantly updated on your own progress. It is also useful for helping set yourself milestones for tasks leading up to the deadline which is great for time management. Sliding tasks between each list also means that I can assess my own progress and also assess within my timeline how I need to prioritise my tasks in order to work most effectively. If I have new ideas while away from my laptop, having Trello on my phone means I can make new cards for these on the mobile app and expand upon these ideas once i’m back on my laptop. I have also found the colour coding function very useful for not confusing the subsections of my tasks.

  <h2 class="page_one_heading">1.4-Describe the risks that might impact digital projects </h2>
  <p class="page_one_a">
    Digital projects like any projects can suffer negatively from human error. However, an additional element of  a digital project means that as well as human error you also have to account for the technology you’re using failing too. An example of this would be if the internet connection is weak or fails, your project would be delayed, especially if you haven’t previously set up an offline mode. The risk of digital projects is working with technology that can be unpredictable, computers can crash randomly and is unpredictable, this can lead to the loss of work. The only way to counter this would be to save work frequently and periodically. Lack of knowledge and planning can also hinder a digital project, therefore it’s important to research and plan before starting your project. Whilst you can research during a project it takes away from time that could be used working on the project itself.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2 class="page_one_heading">1.5-Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
  <p class="page_one_a">
    Selecting the correct technology for you to utilize during your project is wholly dependent on you and your project's requirements. If you are creating a project by yourself you are more likely to do a lot of travelling and therefore a laptop would be a more astute choice as it is portable and would mean you are able to work on the go, thereby increasing your efficiency. However, if your project doesn’t require you to travel or you’re working in a team from an office, then a desktop computer would be a preferable choice. Regardless of which you choose, you would have to assure that each computer had the appropriate specifications that would allow it to work with the software you use for your project. Previous research into which programmes would be most optimal for your project would therefore also be necessary. Additionally, as with any digital project it is likely a stable internet would be required in order for the project to be completed smoothly, whether that be for the project itself or to aid in communication.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2 class="page_one_heading">1.6-Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h2>
  <p class="page_one_a">
    During the planning process I utilized the site Trello to help plan out the separate sections of my website, page by page. I also used it to break down the sections necessary for my written work in order to more effectively utilize the site space and make it easy to read. As such without this technology I could have lost track of my project and become overwhelmed by the amount of work to be done. Whilst GitHub<a href="https://github.com/">[11]</a> does offer some planning technologies, having a dedicated space such as Trello is useful for compartmentalizing tasks which I personally find aids me in working more efficiently and more productively. GitHub however was useful for other purposes, predominantly sharing my project once it’s complete via the online interface to use as part of an online profile for prospective future employees to view my work and progress.

  <h2 class="page_one_heading">1.7-Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h2>
  <p class="page_one_a">
    From May 2018, the EU enacted legislation known as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) which has become known as the strictest privacy and information law in the world. Essentially it regulates all personal data collected and stored by companies for the protection of individuals against data crimes that may be committed if the data is mishandled. For companies and digital projects this can mean implementing “technical measures meaning anything from requiring your employees to use two-factor authentication on accounts where personal data are stored to contracting with cloud providers that use end-to-end encryption.” <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">[12].</a> As for employees and colleagues working on digital projects it is vital hey have an understanding of GDPR and the individual companies data privacy policy. Additionally, limiting who has access to this information within a team can also help. Companies and employees are to be informed and held accountable for their handling of personal data and failure to do so can result in penalties and fines, “which max out at €20 million or 4% of global revenue (whichever is higher), plus data subjects have the right to seek compensation for damages” <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">[12].</a>
