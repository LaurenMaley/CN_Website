    <h2 class="page_one_heading">2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h2>
    <P class="page_one_a">
        As previously mentioned Trello has been incredibly useful in the planning of my project, and whilst there are similar tools available the minimalist layout of Trello is one that I was most comfortable utilizing. Similarly whilst there are alternatives to Visual Code Studio (VSC) <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">[13]</a>, for beginners such as myself the versatility of VSC is easy to maneuver without too much understanding or research required. The ability to customise your workspace in VSC is also good as you can adjust the programme aesthetics to match your workstyle for more readable code. In addition, the ability to add extensions into VSC for other coding apps is also useful for expanding my ability and my projects reach. As is standard in the coding industry, the use of search websites to improve my knowledge and my coding ability has been invaluable not only for my current project but for future usage too.

    <h2 class="page_one_heading">2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate </h2>
    <P class="page_one_a">
        In regards to the use of Trello for my projects, I believe it to be significantly more useful for team projects as opposed to individual projects. This applies for me personally, as I am a rather motivated person who is able to self-start and work autonomously. When using Trello for team work it enables you to track your own progress -as much as anyone else's- and when working to a deadline as part of a team this is more important. Whereas the ability to self-manage means that for me personally Trello is not as effectively implemented in an individual project. However, if organisation is something you have difficulty with then Trello would also be useful in individual projects.  When working with VSC, I believe it was the most appropriate programme to use in comparison to online alternatives as it’s offline functionality allows for continuous offline productivity, and therefore does not rely on the need for constant online connection. Additionally, as previously mentioned, the ability to change code aesthetics within the programme was useful for finding the visual style that helped me work most efficiently.

    <h2 class="page_one_heading">2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2>
    <P class="page_one_a">
        Visually, in terms of colour palette, I am very happy with the website I have created. Through use of a colour palette website <a href="https://imagecolorpicker.com/en/">[14]</a> I was able to match my website’s aesthetic to the background header image I had selected. This creates an overall more pleasing aesthetic for any site users. Regarding the image I selected to use as my menu/header background, whilst I am happy with the image and think it represents me and my personality well. I think that considering the project’s subject matter is technology, that perhaps a more topical image could have been used instead. Alternatively, I would have liked to find time to utilize my Photoshop skills to create my own background and icons for use within my website. However, the time constraint of the project meant that it wasn’t possible at this time. Additionally, whilst I am happy with the font I have used throughout the website as it is the same font used in coding; I would also have liked to do something more with the font, perhaps by researching and implementing animation. Furthermore, whilst I have used some images in my website, I would have liked to implement icons or image based bullet points to create a more visually dynamic website.

    <h2 class="page_one_heading">2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
    <div class="page_one_a">
        Improvements I could have made to my project include:
    <ul>
        <li>Use of a more exciting colour palette</li>
        <li>A more technology themed design</li>
        <li>Implementation of animation coding</li>
        <li>Creation of my own graphics</li>
        <li>Use of icons</li>
        <li>A more intricate contact me page</li>
        <li>Use of a more intricate code for a dropdown menu</li>
        <li>Columns as a means of website layout</li>
        <li>Implementation of CSS transitions</li>
    </ul>
        As you can see from the list above any improvements I would make to the website would be made predominantly through additions to CSS rather than HTML and would utilize additional programming and skills such as photoshop.

    <h2 class="page_one_heading">2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
    <P class="page_one_a">
        For this website creation project I set out to create a website that was functional, in that it could present the information I wished to display on the site,hence my use of HTML which I believe to be the most suitable choice. Another goal when creating the website was to have it represent me in terms of style and design therefore I implemented use of CSS as it works well and is compatible with HTML. “For most websites across the world, CSS is the platform to opt for if they need help to create visually attractive web pages...The language’s syntax is pretty similar to that of HTML and XHTML, which work well in synchronization and combination of one another.” <a href="https://www.cleverism.com/programming-languages-web-development/">[15]</a> These coding languages were implemented via VSC as it is an easy to use application for coding. Overall, I think that I used the most appropriate programmes for the outcome I desired.
